# Word2Vec Implementation and Experiments
### The experiment collection includes following content: 
- generate batch for skip-gram model
- implement two loss functions to train word embeddings
- tune the parameters for word embeddings (Word2Vec)
- apply best learned word embeddings to word analogy task
- calculate bias score on your best models
- create a new task on which you would run WEAT test
